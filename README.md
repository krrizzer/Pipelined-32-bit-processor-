# Pipelined-32-bit-processor-
This is a Pipelined 32-bit processor with 16-bit instructions
Using the Logisim simulator for model and testing the processor


this is a RISC processor that has seven 32-bit registers: R1 to R7. Register R0 is hardwired to zero. Reading R0 always returns the value 0. Writing R0 has no effect. The value written to R0 is discarded.
All instructions are 16-bit long and aligned in memory. The PC register contains the instruction address. The lower bit of the PC register is hardwired to 0. All instruction addresses are even. There are three instruction formats, R-format, I-format, and J-format as shown below
